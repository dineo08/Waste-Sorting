Assessment Description
 
Build a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API for clients:

Design RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to expose the required functionalities for
data retrieval and manipulation.
Define resource URIs, request methods, request/response payloads, and error
handling mechanisms for each endpoint.
Implement endpoints to save/update/delete/retrieve data such as waste
categories, disposal guidelines, and recycling tips.
Ensure that the endpoints return JSON-formatted responses containing relevant
data in a structured format.
Implement input validation using Spring Boot validation annotations to ensure the
integrity and validity of incoming requests and data payloads
